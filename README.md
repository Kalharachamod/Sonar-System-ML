# Sonar Signal Classification - Rock vs Mine

This project builds a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines using Python. The goal is to accurately predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine based on signal patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset contains sonar signal returns collected from metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. Each row represents a sonar signal with 60 features and a label indicating rock or mine.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the sonar dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features if necessary.

3. **Model Training**  
   Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) on the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

5. **Visualization**  
   Plot important graphs to visualize data distribution and model performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
```

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Sonar-System-ML.git](https://github.com/yourusername/Sonar-System-ML.git)

```

2. Install required libraries  
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Run the main script  
```

python sonar\_classification.py

```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of around **[insert accuracy]%** on the test set, effectively distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar signals.
